All route tests are done using POSTMAN, an advanced REST-client that makes it easier to analyse and send HTTP-requests.
POSTMAN is available as a Google Chrome plugin @ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm

Tests are grouped into collections by functionality (users/publications/...) and are provided in this folder using some JSON-encoding.
These JSON's are generated by POSTMAN and can be viewed/executed/... by importing them back into the webapp.

TL;DR: Load into Postman for maximum effect!
