Skribl_web
==========

> SKRIBLE is something new. Its something that will deal with academical writings, be it papers, journals, or anything remotely related. Furthermore it will be some kind of professional social network. We think. 

> But hey, we just started, cut us some slack! Lets see how far we can push this thing.

## Install

### Unix
- Fire up terminal.app
- Navigate to the directory of Skribl_web (make sure you can see "index.html" when pressing | ls; |) 
- type | python -m SimpleHTTPServer; |
- open up your favorite browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8000/"

### Windows
Don't know, don't wanna know. At this point you can probably just run the index.html
